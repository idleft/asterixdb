In this branch, I cannot find a good way to keep the feed alive, i.e., to keep records 
flow throw the pipeline.
There are two possible ways of doing this:
1. Replace the empty tuple source with feed intake op
2. Replace the MetaOp with the feed intak op.
The 2nd one wouldn't work since the project is missing so the record
doesn't have a proper primary key.
